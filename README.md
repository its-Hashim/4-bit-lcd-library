This is a header file written in atmel studio to operate a 16X2 LCD in 4-bit mode

HOW TO USE THE LIBRARY

FIRST YOU HAVE TO INCLUDE THE LIBRARY IN YOUR CODE (GO THROUGH THE LAST LINK TO KNOW HOW TO DO INCLUDE COSTOM LIBRARY)
USE THE FUNTION clear(); TO CLEAR THE SCREAN
TO PRINT ANY CHARECHTER USE THE FUNCTION printcharechter('X'); X IS THE CHARECTOR YOU WANT TO DISPLAY
TO PRINT SENTENSES USE THE FUNCTION printword("SENTENCES");
TO PRINT INTEGER DATA USE THE FUNCTION printInt(x); X IS THE INTEGER YOU WANT TO DISPLAY
TO PRINT FLOAT OR DOUBLE DATA USE THE FUNCTION printDouble(x); X IS THE FLOAT OR DAUBLE DATA YOU WANT TO DISPLAY
TO MOVE THE CURSOR USE THE FUNCTION setCursor(x,y); x AND Y IS THE X-AXIS AND Y-AXIS OF SCREAN WHERE THE ORIGIN IS THE TOP LEFT POINT

YOU CAN DO A LOT IN THE SCREAN LIKE PLAYING THE SNAKE GAME IN THE SCREAN AND DISPLAYING COSTOM CHARECTOR IN THE SCREAN
YOU CAN ACTUALLY PRINT ANYTHING ON THE DISPLAY.

YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE KNOLEDGE OF 16*2 LCD AND HOW THEY WORKS
